        The csc is accessed as ``self.csc`` and the remote as ``self.remote``.

        This override reads and checks all but the last ``controllerState``
        event during startup, in addition to the ``summaryState`` event.

        Parameters
        ----------
        name : `str`
            Name of SAL component.
        initial_state : `lsst.ts.salobj.State` or `int`, optional
            The initial state of the CSC. Defaults to STANDBY.
        config_dir : `str`, optional
            Directory of configuration files, or `None` (the default)
            for the standard configuration directory (obtained from
            `ConfigureCsc._get_default_config_dir`).
        simulation_mode : `int`, optional
            Simulation mode. Defaults to 0 because not all CSCs support
            simulation. However, tests of CSCs that support simulation
            will almost certainly want to set this nonzero.
        log_level : `int` or `None`, optional
            Logging level, such as `logging.INFO`.
            If `None` then do not set the log level, leaving the default
            behavior of `SalInfo`: increase the log level to INFO.
        timeout : `float`
            Time limit for the CSC to start (seconds).
        **kwargs : `dict`
            Extra keyword arguments for `basic_make_csc`.
            For a configurable CSC this may include ``override``,
            especially if ``initial_state`` is DISABLED or ENABLED.

        Notes
        -----
        Adds a logging.StreamHandler if one is not already present.
